vonmises-icml-2023
==============================================

vonmises-icml-2023 implements VonMisesNet, as described in the paper
`Von Mises Mixture Distributions for Molecular Conformation Generation <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07472.pdf>`_.
VonMisesNet is a new
graph neural network that can generate conformations for molecules in a way that is both physically accurate with
respect to the Boltzmann distribution and orders of magnitude faster than existing sampling methods.
